# **App Name**: Spooky Tales Prompt

## Core Features:

- Card Display: Display one card at a time with a creepy image and a short phrase as a story prompt.
- Custom Card Creation: Allow users to input their own creepy images and phrases to create custom cards.
- Card Shuffling: Implement a shuffle function to randomize the order of the cards.
- AI Story Starter: Incorporate an AI "tool" that provides example story starters based on the card shown.

## Style Guidelines:

- Use a dark color palette with shades of gray and deep blues to create a spooky atmosphere.
- Accent color: Use a blood red (#9B2226) for interactive elements and highlights to add a touch of horror.
- Select a font that looks slightly gothic or handwritten to enhance the creepy feeling.
- Use eerie and minimalist icons for navigation and card manipulation (e.g., shuffle, add). Icons should be easily recognizable but subtly unsettling.
- The card should be centered on the screen with enough padding to draw focus on the image and text. Controls should be intuitive and easily accessible.
- Implement subtle animations, such as a slight fade-in effect when a new card is displayed, to maintain user engagement without being distracting.
